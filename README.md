# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## What I Did

* I started out with the html layout so that way it would be easier for my jquery to link up.
* I then sstarted to add some css to sytle the page.
* I then started working on getting the weather API to link up so that I could get the weather information.
* I then realized that the forecast would need a different website so I created a function for it as well.
* After some trial and error I was able to figure out how to get the uv-index to work.
* I was able to get the results for the 5 day forcast on the page.
* The final piece I worked on was the local storage. I was able to set things in and pull them out but was not able to make them in list form.
